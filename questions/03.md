# Question 4

What happens if you run `git commit` and forget to include a commit message?

## Correct

Neither of these choices is true

## Incorrect

Git aborts the commit

> Not quite! Git opens a new file to allow you to enter a commit message. It only
> aborts the commit if you close the file without entering a commit message and
> saving it first.

## Incorrect

By default, Git opens a file in whatever text editor you normally use, allowing
you to enter a commit message.

> Not quite! Git opens a file in the default Git command line editor. In order for
> Git to use VS Code (or other text editor) as the Git command line editor, you
> need to configure that separately.

## Incorrect

I don't know

> Be sure to review the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time!
