# Question 12

Why would you fork a repository before cloning?

## Correct

So that you can collaborate with the repository's owner

> CORRECT!! When you create a fork in a repository, you are creating your own
> branch in the repository so that you can work with the repository locally to
> make changes to the contents of the repository and submit a pull request for the
> owner to review your suggested changes.

## Incorrect

So that you can pull changes down

> Creating the fork and cloning it pulls the current state of the repository at
> that point, but any future changes will need to be pulled manually.

## Incorrect

So that you can publish any changes you make

> You can publish changes to the contents of the repository by simply cloning,
> although your changes will not be added as suggestions on the original
> repository without forking.

## Incorrect

So that you can have the repo locally

> Cloning alone will give you the contents of the repository for you to work with,
> there is no need to fork unless you wish to collaborate with the original
> repository owner.

## Incorrect

I don't know
